What does this code do:
First the code calls from_binsparse on the wrapper to translate from binsparse COO.
Once that is done the out-degree of the adjacency is found by summing columns, giving
us the number of outbound links per page. If out-degree is not 0, we divide by k
(the number of outbound links). If out-degree is 0, that means the node had no links,
so we distribute it evenly among all nodes to preserve probability mass. We then run
iteration multiple times so that the PageRank vector converges to its theoretical
stationary value.

Statement on the use of Generative AI:
AI was not used in order to write this benchmark function.
AI might have been used for the purposes of genreating
test cases for the algorithm that was implemented, picking
up any unfamiliar python syntax, and cleaning up written documentation
flow.
