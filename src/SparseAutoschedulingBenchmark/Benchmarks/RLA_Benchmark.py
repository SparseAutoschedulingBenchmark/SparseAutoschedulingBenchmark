Name: Randomized Numerical Linear Algebra and Algorithms. 
Author: Vilohith Gokarakonda
The purpose of this is to create python tests that are for Randomized Linear Algebra methods.
    Specifically, I will first show the application of the Johnson Lindenstrauss Lemma for Nearest Neighbor. 
    My goal is to write benchmarks on applications of Randomized Numerical Linear Algebra, paticuarily
    for graph algorithms, PDEs, and Scientific Machine Learning.
    Next PR will be from this paper: SPARSE GRAPH BASED SKETCHING FOR FAST NUMERICAL LINEAR ALGEBRA
    My semester goal project will be to understand Learning Greenâ€™s functions associated with time-dependent
    partial differential equations and start writing code in Finchlite an understand finch implementation of these methods.
