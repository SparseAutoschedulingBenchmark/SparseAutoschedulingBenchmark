Name: Breadth-First Search (BFS)

Motivation: The Bredth-First Search algorithm is an important graph traversal technique
used to epxlore vertices by layers. It is a fundamental building block for more complex
graph algorithms, especially in areas like parallel processing and high-performance
computing. It is often parallelized to run on GPUs for speed.

Role of sparsity:
In standard BFS, algorithms on sparse graphs are faster because they process fewer
edges, and specialized algebraic methods use sparsity to avoid unnecessary computations
by focusing only on non-zero elements. Optimizing the use of sparse data structures and
algorithms is key to achieving high performance, as it reduces memory footprint and
leads to faster traversals.

Data Generation:
Graphs for this benchmark may be created manually for testing or generated
procedurally using a Graph500-style R-MAT model. Generated adjacency matrices
are converted into the benchmark format with BinsparseFormat.from_numpy().
