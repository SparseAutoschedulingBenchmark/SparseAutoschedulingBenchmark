Name: Triangle, 4-Clique Counting
Author: Jeffrey Xu
Email: jxu743@gatech.edu

Motivation:
"It is generally known that counting the exact number of
triangles in a graph G can be described using the language of
linear algebra as 1/6 Γ(A3),
where A is the adjacency matrix of the graph G, and Γ(X)
is the trace of the square matrix X [1]. Other linear algebra
approaches [2], [3] also require a sparse-matrix multiplication
of A or parts of A as part of their computation. Alternative
approaches that are not based on linear algebra leverage other
formats for describing graphs such as the adjacency list to
design their algorithms [4], [5]."

Role of Sparsity: 
Adjacency matrices are often sparse, and are used as input in this problem.

Implementation:
These methods are implemented using the property that multiplying a graph's adjacency matrix by itself n times yields the number of walks of length n
that begin at the vertex denoted by the row label and end at the vertex denoted by the column label.

Triangle Counting: Given adjacency matrix A, # triangles = trace(A^3) // 6. This counts the number of walks of length 3 that start at vertex i
and end at vertex i, which is exactly a triangle. Divide by 6 to avoid overcounting.

4-clique Counting: A 4-clique must contain 6 edges that connect all 4 vertices. The einsum does the following: for a given vertex i, checks for existence
of 3 edges to 3 other vertices, then checks for existence of 3 edges between those 3 vertices. This constitutes a 4-clique. Divide by 24 to avoid overcounting.

Data Generation:

Statement on the use of Generative AI:
No generative AI was used to write the benchmark function itself. Generative
AI was used to debug code. This statement was written by hand.
